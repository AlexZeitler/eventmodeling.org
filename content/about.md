Event Modeling was coined by Adam Dymitruk by building on long-running process specifications that Greg Young used in CQRS/ES systems. Alebrto Brandolini's Event Storming format was integrated to adopt the workshop format. The final piece was the UI/UX aspects to complete what more resembles a movie story board. In the recent years many organizations were able to get on the same page with all departments and get their projects done with much greater efficiency.
