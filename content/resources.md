## Slack Group

The community needed a non-technical discussion on Information System design. The Slack channel was created to create an environment where this type of discussion could happen and allow a new avenue for the practice to get adopted. You can join the community throught this [link](https://join.slack.com/t/eventmodeling/shared_invite/enQtNjc1NDk0NjcwMjQ2LTM3NjY5MmE1ODE0MDU3MzU2MzcyNGRiZDZjNTNkOTJmOTNmNzU2NjRjMzNlYjE4ZmViMTllODUwZjY1M2E3Yjk)

## Intro Video

This is the first public recording of a talk on Event Modeling. It was recorded at the Event-Driven Meetup in Seattle, WA. James Nugent was presenting on the Raft consensus algorithm that same night.

In the demos of event modeling, [Miro Realtime Board](https://miro.com) is used. If you would like to get started from a small example, you can download the example event model above from [here](/event-modeling.rtb).

## Implementation Gist

![trello screenshot](../trello-screenshot.png)

This script only requires [fish shell](https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell) and a couple of command line utilities to show the above example work. You can find it in a gist [here](https://gist.github.com/adymitruk/7fc2adb8598ad861d4b3dae114afd4c9).
